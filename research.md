I am a computational biologist working on problems affecting human health. I am
especially interested in the biological basis of complex traits and behaviors.

Currently, I am developing algorithms for discovering biomarkers in ALS. Most cases of ALS
are sporadic. We do not understand the cause of the disease well, and monitoring
or diagnosing the disease is difficult because of a lack of a clear biological marker. To solve
this problem, we are leveraging advanced statistical techniques to create an efficient
test that learns a patient's disease state from a simple blood draw. We're
doing this via circulating cell-free DNA.
