I am currently working writing and illustrating a children's book about the wonderful
world of cells! These are a few of my favorite drawings so far. I'm trying to
find the style I like best so these are very rough ideas, but I hope you like them anyway.

*Inspired by viruses but in no way actually scientifically accurate* 

![eukaryotes1](/assets/images/art2.jpg)
*Eukaryotic cells done in kind of a Warhol style but not really*

![eukaryotes2](/assets/images/art4.jpg)
*More eukaryotic cells*

![eukaryotes3](/assets/images/art5.jpg)
*Even more eukaryotes!!!*

![plants](/assets/images/art3.jpg)
*Plant cells inspired from [here](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/81/5a/8e/815a8e19fcd34feb9f2a578abb212795.jpg)*

![protists1](/assets/images/art6.jpg)
*Some sick diatoms! Image inspired from [here](https://assets.labroots.com/_public/_files/system/ck/trending/Diatom-008-2400_62cb1b5c485a08add9709693a05c40c7.jpg)*
