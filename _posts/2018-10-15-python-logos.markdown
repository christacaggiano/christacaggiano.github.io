My [boyfriend](aryaboudaie.com) loves [Python](https://www.python.org/) (the programming language). He probably loves it more than me, which is probably a story for another time. Unfortunately for him, and for Python lovers everywhere, the Python logo is kind of ugly.

So, in the spirit of my lame, science-themed art, I made some cool Python logos and Python art over the years.
