Hi! I am a graduate student at [UCLA](https://bioinformatics.ucla.edu/) studying bioinformatics. Before coming to UCLA, I started my PhD at UCSF. Before that, I studied at [Brandeis University](http://www.brandeis.edu/), where I majored in biological physics and art history.

At Brandeis, I worked in the [Rosbash lab](http://www.bio.brandeis.edu/rosbash-lab/) where I studied circadian rhythms. My honors thesis, entitled *Bioinformatic approaches to chromatin structure and RNA editing in Drosophila* can be found [here][1] if you're that kind of a nerd.  

My scientific interests now fall broadly in neurogenetics and the genetic control of behavior. Currently, I'm working on [this](https://github.com/christacaggiano/Zaitlen_lab) in the [Zaitlen lab](zaitlenlab.ucsf.edu).

Besides science, I am interested in art and design. My favorite museums include the [Isabella Stewart Gardner](https://www.gardnermuseum.org/) in Boston, [the RISD Museum](https://risdmuseum.org/) in Providence, the [Brooklyn Museum](https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/) in NYC, and the [Asian Art Museum](http://www.asianart.org/).
Recently, I've been getting into Islamic art and architecture (the [Met](https://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-met/curatorial-departments/ancient-near-eastern-art) has cool examples of this).

Please enjoy this website to the fullest extent of the law.
