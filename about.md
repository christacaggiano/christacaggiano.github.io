##### Christa Caggiano, Computational Biologist

Hi! I am a graduate student at [UCLA](https://bioinformatics.ucla.edu/) where I study bioinformatics in the lab of [Noah Zaitlen](http://zaitlenlab.science/). I started my PhD at UCSF, before following the Zaitlen lab to sunny Los Angeles. Before that, I studied at [Brandeis University](http://www.brandeis.edu/), where I majored in biological physics and art history.

My scientific interests fall broadly in neurogenetics and the genetic control of behavior. Currently, I'm working on developing statistical learning methods to find biomarkers for ALS. Code for this work can be found [here](https://github.com/christacaggiano/celfie).

Besides science, I am interested in art and design. My favorite museums include the [Isabella Stewart Gardner](https://www.gardnermuseum.org/) in Boston, [the RISD Museum](https://risdmuseum.org/) in Providence, the [Brooklyn Museum](https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/) in NYC, and the [Asian Art Museum](http://www.asianart.org/) in San Francisco.
