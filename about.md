##### Christa Caggiano, Computational Biologist

Hi! I am a graduate student at [UCLA](https://bioinformatics.ucla.edu/) where I study bioinformatics in the lab of [Noah Zaitlen](http://zaitlenlab.science/). Before coming to UCLA, I started my PhD at UCSF. I did my undergrad degree at [Brandeis University](http://www.brandeis.edu/), where I majored in biological physics and art history. There, I worked in the [Rosbash Lab](http://www.bio.brandeis.edu/rosbash-lab/), studying the transcriptional accessibility of circadian genes.

My scientific interests now fall broadly in neurogenetics and the genetic control of behavior. Currently, I'm working on developing statistical learning methods to find biomarkers for ALS. Code for this work can be found [here](https://github.com/christacaggiano/celfie).

Besides science, I am interested in art and design. My favorite museums include the [Isabella Stewart Gardner](https://www.gardnermuseum.org/) in Boston, [the RISD Museum](https://risdmuseum.org/) in Providence, the [Brooklyn Museum](https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/) in NYC, and the [Asian Art Museum](http://www.asianart.org/) in San Francisco.
